# Personal_Projects

Hello to you who visit my projects.
Don't be critical because I'm learning please ðŸ˜‡

Here I put my little ideas to apply some concepts seen in class.
They'll often be tiny bits of code, but that's on purpose.
It's my way of learning while having fun ðŸ˜‰

I wish you a pleasant day and thank you for your visit ðŸ˜„
